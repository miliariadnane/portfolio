I'm a dedicated Backend Engineer with a strong passion for learning and professional growth with developers and teams, sharing knowledge and experience, and building great software.

Currently, I am working as a Backend Developer at [Transperfect](https://www.transperfect.com/) where I am helping to build transaltion and localization solutions for the world's largest companies.

I'm very dedicated to learn new things and firmly believe that learning should never cease. I enjoy creating different things by contributing to open source projects, writing technical articles and giving talks.

When I am not coding you can find me playing football, having fun with friends or pick up new skills.
